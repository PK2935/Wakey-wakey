**Project Description**
**Wake Me Up with Memes** is an innovative and fun project designed to wake users up with laughter! The project utilizes a camera interface to detect facial expressions such as yawning, drowsiness, and alertness. Once the system detects a state of drowsiness or sleep, it automatically plays random video memes to wake the user up in a lighthearted and engaging manner.

This Python-based application leverages advanced computer vision libraries to ensure accurate, lag-free performance in real-time. It's perfect for anyone who needs a little extra motivation to stay awake or for those who love starting their day with a smile.

**Key Features**
1) Facial Expression Detection: Detects common indicators of drowsiness such as yawning or closed eyes.
2) Real-time Analysis: The camera continuously monitors the user's face to identify changes in alertness.
3) Random Meme Player: Upon detecting signs of drowsiness, the system automatically plays random video memes to wake the user up.
4) Custom Meme Collection: Users can personalize their experience by adding their favorite meme videos to the collection.
5) High Performance: Built with high-performance libraries to ensure smooth detection and quick meme responses, avoiding any lag or delays.

**Technologies Used**
1) Python: The core language for building the application.
2) OpenCV: Used for real-time facial detection and expression analysis.
3) Dlib or Mediapipe: For detecting facial landmarks and expressions (such as yawning or closed eyes).
4) PyAutoGUI or other video-playing libraries: For playing random meme videos based on detection.
5) Numpy: For handling and processing image arrays efficiently.
6) Tkinter: Optional GUI interface for users to control meme collections, set preferences, etc.

**How It Works**
A. Camera Activation: The system activates the camera and starts analyzing the userâ€™s facial expressions in real-time.
B. Drowsiness Detection: Using OpenCV and facial landmark detection, the system tracks signs like yawning or closed eyes, which indicate drowsiness.
C. Trigger Meme Playback: Once drowsiness is detected, the system instantly plays a random meme from the stored video collection.
D. Stay Alert: The system repeats this cycle until the user shows signs of being fully awake (alert expressions).
